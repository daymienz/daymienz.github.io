            <h2> My Future </h2>
            <h3> HighSchool </h3>

            <p> Poly  : Since I want to be in the NBA in the future, I want to go to Poly. Poly has a program named PACE and it is a program that has multiple subjects, and is very difficult. This will go good on my resume for any job. Poly also has a very good basketball team that will help me out. 
                Wilson  : This school offers the WAVE program that is nearly the same as PACE. This is my second choice because I felt that Poly was better for sports. 
                Lakewood  : This would be my last choice due to ATM. This program helps/ adds to what I know from middle school about technology. 
            </p>

            <h3> College </h3>
            <p> College  : The college I want/will go to would be UCLA. This school has one of the best basketball teams, and has a science class for marine life.

            <h3> Career </h3>
            <p> Career Interests  : In the future I would love to be in the NBA. I want to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, or the Golden State Warriors. Playing basketball profressionally would be great! I would get paid for doing what I love.
