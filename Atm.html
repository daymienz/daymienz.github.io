    <p> I made this video to show what I have learned in this unit of recording videos and how to record videos. This video is based around people who get bullied for their size and looks. In order for adults and kids to not feel ashamed of themselves they must commit to their health, my goal is for 15% of the world to be more active and healthy in 2018
