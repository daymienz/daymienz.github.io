        <h3> My Family </h3>

        <p> 
            My family is Mexican. My dad was born in Long Beach, and my mom in Zacatecas. I have 3 brothers, I am the second oldest of them all, and have a dog. My dog is a Great Dane named Katara. My father works in pharmaceuticals and is one of the main managers. My mom on the other hand, is a stay at home mom, and works very hard. She keeps our house very clean, and takes care of the house while we are out.

            My Skills
        </h3>
        <p> 
            I can type around 60 wpm. I also know how to code a website, and customize it too! I have learned to use online programs, and can even say I could teach other people. I also consider myself to be pretty good at basketball, and athleticism. I also have great grades, that will do me good in the future. I have a GPA of 3.8 at the moment.

        <h3> 
            My Hobbies and Interests
        </h3>
        <p> 
            I love to play basketball. I play for a travel team outside of school, and it is really fun. I love to learn basketball to, it takes a lot of patience and time to learn though. Basketball is very fun because it has a lot of intensity, and the game in general. I play basketball on my free time.
